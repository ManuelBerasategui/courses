CURSO DE HTML FREECODECAMP
Hyper Text Markup Language

- NO MORE than h3
	- only 1 h1
	- between 3 and 4 h2 - h3 for subtopics

- Piece of code to turn web page's theme into dark:
	 

This is a CSS code piece

- Live server (extension) is very usefull, to see an IP of our web page, and not a file route.

- Markup Validation service

- href = High reference

- hr: Line to separate sub-topics
. br: line breaker

- you can'r write 2 blocks in the same line

- em: EMPHASIS

- &nsbp; = sangr√≠a (corta)
- &lt = less than... (<)
- &copy = copyright symbol

- abbr symbol represents an abreviation, and puts some dots below the words we've put inside the abbr element

- address: specific location (or address)

- <!-- --> = Comment

- 3 types of lists:
	- Ordered lists
	- Unordered lists
	- Description lists

- <li> = list
- <ol> = ordered list
- <ul> = unordered list
- <dl> = description list
- <dt> = description term
- <dd> = description detail

note: in the web page, the <li> element added some numbers to order the following points:
	...I learn more about web dev.
      ...I plan out my Schedule.
      ...I use resources from 
It added numbers thanks to the <ol> (ordered list)

- Thanks to the <ul> element, it added some dots to order the lines, instead of numbers
- HTML --> HT = Hypertext:Links
- href: links to a page (link needed)
- <a> = anchor tag, it turns blue the text we want it to be a link, and makes it one.


HOMEWORK: CREATE AN ABOUT PAGE 

<section>: shortcut to a place of the same page
- h4 = horizontal rule
- <nav>: navigation area

note: to link a section created in the index page, we need to create an anchor tag (<a>) and then, in the href section write "# + the id we wrote for the specific section"
e.g: href="#html"

Link Text Rule: No links that say "click here". It provides no meaning.

- download atribute, it's used to download what we assign.
	e.g: Download an <a href="html5.png" download>HTML5 favicon</a>

- target tag: opens the page we indicate in another window

- <a href="/HTML/index.html">Back To Home</a> : links us back to the route of our website

IMAGES
- src = source
- alt = description of the image
- title = text that can complement our image, but is not necesarily required. If I put the punter of the mouse on the image, it will display a text that'll contain what we wrote in the title element
- we can change the width and height in the future with css. We give those elements to let the browser know about the size and complementaration.
- loading = 
			- eager: does the opposite from lazy
			- lazy: any image that's below will be shown. helps the page to be faster at loading


- If I disable the cache button on inspectaction of chrome, with the loading atribute set to lazy, the page will only load the image/s that is/are loaded
- figure element: the img element goes inside of it. It's used with a figcaption element inside of it, that gives captions below the image. It's not only for images, it can be used with the code element, for example.
- code = helps you actually to display code inside of a paragraph for example.

- header - main - footer: are different elements to separate and clasificate the different content parts of our website
- label = etiqueta. We label the different nav elements for the sistem to know which nav element is which, if we have more than one
- aria-label = to label a nav element
- article: piece of text that has it's own topic
- aside: another section of complementary text that's not as important as the header
- summary and details elements work together: they hide a piece of text after this elements
- mark element: resaltador
- the time and datetime elements give some meaning to the browser of the hour
- all the html elements: mozila developer network

- fieldset: closes a section of info in a square
- radio: makes a selectable option with the form of a circle
nota: if multiple radio options have the same name atribute, only one of them will be able to be selected.
